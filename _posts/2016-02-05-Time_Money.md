Last week I announced on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/daniel_collin/status/691638832672980992) that I will be taking Fridays off to work on my hobby projects. I would like to alloborate a bit more on this.

Reasoning is simple. I truly enjoy the stuff I do at work but I wanted to spend more time on my hobby projects (so I could write status updates like this one for example) 

So what do I plan to do? I have a bunch of projects running at the same time but I try to limit myself because I would get nothing done otherwise. So here is a list of things I'm working on

* ProDBG (This is by far my main project and will have most focus)
* Demoscene stuff (Can by anything on any platform. I don't have much to write here except I fiddle around with stuff on a regular basis)
* Open Depacker (A bit slower project, you can find it [here](https://github.com/emoon/open_depacker))
* Other various Rust projects I work on (next to ProDBG) best is just to check my Github page.

Also I hope to do a bit more regular updates progress of the projects. I had hopped at this point ProDBG would be in a better state and 0.1+ but that's how things go. Hopefully now I can focus more and get there faster.
