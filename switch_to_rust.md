As some of you know that follows me on twitter I really don't like C++ all that much. It has it's usually issues with having header files, crappy templates and the list goes on.
The problem is what alternatives here is. I looked at switching ot C# but getting that work great on all platforms looked to be a fair amount of challange (for example at the time x64 wasn't supported in an easy way on Mac) and some people didn't like the choice.
